        <h1>How to Do Research With a Professor</h1>
        <h4>by Jason Eisner (2012)</h4>


        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>This is a bit of advice for lucky students who get to do research
        with a professor.</p>

        <p>Take this opportunity seriously.  Either you make it your top
        priority, or you don't do it at all.  That's the message.  Read the
        rest of the page if you want to know why and how.</p>

        <h2>Why This Webpage?</h2>

        <p>I'd find it awkward to say these things directly to a nice undergrad
        or master's student I was starting to work with.  It would feel like talking down to them,
        <!-- heavy-handed and entitled. -->
        <!-- Since I hope and expect that things will work out, I don't want to suggest otherwise. -->
        <!--Like most academics, I am interested in good ideas rather than the
                rank of the people who have the ideas, and I enjoy being around young
                    people and dislike pretentious bigwigs. -->
                    <!-- I don't want to be some big busy self-important Herr Doktor
                        Professor who acts superior and calls all the shots.  Rather, -->
                        whereas I like my research collaborators&mdash;however junior&mdash;to
                        talk with me comfortably as equals, have fun, and come up with half
                        the ideas.</p>

        <p>Still, it's important to understand up front what the pressures are
          on faculty-student collaborations.  So here are some things to bear
            in mind.</p>

        <h2>How the Professor Sees It</h2>

        <blockquote id="sexchange"><i>[If the professor is female/male, click <u>here</u>.]</i></blockquote>

        <p>Your research advisor doesn't get much credit for working with
        junior students, and would find it easier and safer to work with
        senior students.  It's just that someone gave <i>him/her</i> a chance
        once: that's how he/she ended up where he/she is today.  He/She'd like
        to pay that debt forward.</p>

        <p>But should it be paid forward to <i>you</i>?  Choosing you
          represents a substantial commitment on your advisor's part, and a
            vote of confidence in you.</p>

        <h3>Time Investment</h3>

        <p>The hours that your advisor spends with you, one-on-one, are hours that
        he/she no longer has available for</p>
        <ul>
            <li> retaining the semblance of a plausible life (sleeping / eating / parenting / avoiding divorce)
                <li> consulting at rates of hundreds of dollars per hour
                    <li> preparing for class
                        <li> working on research with other students (grad or undergrad) or by himself/herself
                            <li> staying current with the latest papers and techniques in the field
                                <li> discharging many administrative and reviewing responsibilities
        </ul>

        <p>So he/she does expect that you'll pay him/her back, by working as hard as he/she
        did when he/she got his/her chance.</p>

        <h3>Research Agenda Investment</h3>

        <p>Your advisor is not onis quite different from
        what you'll learn in the classroom.</p>

                      about ideas, right?)  Even if he/she doesn't have anything for
                        you, he/she may be able to hook you up with a colleague.</p>
