================== EMAIL QUERY, from December 2021 ============================================

Respected sir,

My name is XYZ. I am a 4th year undergraduate student at ABC, India. I am writing this email because I am interested in doing a remote research internship under your guidance.

Sir, I have been learning and doing projects in the field of Deep Learning and Machine Learning for the past one year. In my second year I have worked on various projects such as PQR using CNNs and MNO on S&P 500 Data. I am also carrying out academic research under Dr ABC (a US University) on video enhancement algorithms. I am also interested in fields related to human computer interaction or cognitive science domain. And I also intend to do higher studies in these fields.

I would love to do research on innovative and realistic projects; thus exploring and learning under your guidance.

I am ready to start my internship remotely and work till we can publish impactful papers .  
You can check about me in these links:

You can also find more about the projects that I have worked on in my resume that I have attached with this mail.

Regards,
XYZ

thanks for writing to me, XXX.
i'm afraid i don't have any projects which you can directly contribute to.

what i would recommend instead are 
- try out something like https://offnote.co/apply/

- keep a lookout on linkedin for professors to publish vacancies
e.g. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/prathosh-ap-phd-50ab9511_ihb-jm2022pdf-activity-6872553488916738048-qZ1L

- look at what some college clubs are doing, and see if you can collaborate with them.
e.g. https://cyberlabs.club/

- start reading papers+codebases, and start thinking for yourself what problems might be interesting, and try those tweaks for yourself.
that's far more valuable than reaching out to folks and asking them if you can tag along to any projects they're working on.

- start personalizing your emails. it's quite clear you've sent out this email to a bunch of profiles you've found out from the internet. nothing wrong in that, but if you really want to work w someone - do your homework. figure out what they're working on, try to understand the work for yourself, ask a meaningful question about it, see if they have a code repo for any of their projects - and if yes, download and play around with it, and then perhaps write to them about what you learnt from that exercise. people appreciate such well informed email queries.
it's a lot of hard work, but it's well worth it.

since you presumably want to work on ML, focus on developing very strong fundamentals/working knowledge of pytorch and related libraries.

you're on the right track. please be patient, and be consistent w your effort to learn and innovate. 

all the best.
shashank.
