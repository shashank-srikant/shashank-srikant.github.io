		   Extant program assessment systems score mostly based on the number of test-cases passed, providing no insight into the competency of the programmer. In addition to grading a program on its programming practices and complexity, the key kernel of the system we designed is a machine-learning based algorithm which determines closeness of the logic of the given program to a correct program. This algorithm uses a set of highly-informative features, derived from the abstract representations of a given program, that capture the program's functionality. These features are then used to learn a model to grade the programs, which are built against evaluations done by experts.
		   </p>
		   <p style="text-align:justify;">
		   Having solved this problem, we found ourselves training models for every programming question we designed, which was a time/human expensive effort. This impedes scaling such a system to new content. We address this issue by presenting a method to grade computer programs which requires no labeled samples for grading responses to a new, unseen question. We extend our previous work wherein we introduced a grammar of features to learn question specific models. In this work, we propose a method to transform those features into a set of features that maintain their structural relation with the labels across questions. Using these features we learn one supervised model across questions, which can then be applied to an ungraded response to an unseen question.

	  <h4>Analyzing test case statistics</h4>
	  <h5>Work done with Varun Aggarwal. Used internally in the group as a tool</h5>
	  <h5><a href="http://research.aspiringminds.com/test-case-analytics/" target="_blank">[Blog post]</a></h5>
		   <p style="text-align:justify;">
		   Test cases evaluate whether a computer program is doing what it’s supposed to do. There are various ways to generate them – automatically based on specifications, say by ensuring code coverage or by subject matter experts (SMEs) who think through conditions based on the problem specification. We asked ourselves whether there was something we could learn by looking at how student programs responded to test cases. Could this help us design better test cases or find flaws in them? By looking at such responses from a data-driven perspective, we wanted to know whether we could .a. design better test cases .b. understand whether there existed any clusters in the way responses on test cases were obtained and .c.  whether we could discover salient concepts needed to solve a particular programming problem, which would then inform us of the right pedagogical interventions. We built a cool tool which helped us look at statistics on over 2500 test cases spread across over fifty programming problems attempted by nearly 18,000 students and job-seekers in a span of four weeks!
