He is advised by Una-May O'Reilly. His research interests are at the intersection of machine learning, program analysis, and cognitive neuroscience. He has published his work at top-tier academic venues and has authored multiple patents.

Prior to his Ph.D. studies, he was a senior researcher at Aspiring Minds' research lab, where he researched, deployed, and managed a number of innovative products involving machine learning. These products are used by >1M job applicants across the world today. In this role, he also helped organize international workshops, led academic collaborations, and helped set up communities in India to participate and engage in ML and data science (http://www.datasciencekids.org, http://ml-india.org).

He is also interested in governance. To understand the nuances of how state governments deliver benefits to the last-mile, he worked with Seva Setu, an organization which aims to bridge the gap between governments and people, for a year in rural Bihar in India.
