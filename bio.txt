Shashank is currently a Ph.D. candidate CS & AI Lab (CSAIL), in the department of Electrical engineering and Computer science (EECS) at MIT. His research interests are at the intersection of machine learning, program analysis, and cognitive neuroscience. His research has been published at highly selective global venues like ICLR and KDD, and his work has led to multiple patents.

Prior to his Ph.D. studies, he was a senior research engineer at Aspiring Minds' research lab, where he helped build, deploy, and manage a number of innovative products involving machine learning. These products are used by >1M job applicants across the world today. In this role, he helped organize international workshops, led academic collaborations, and helped set up communities in India to participate and engage in ML and data science (http://www.datasciencekids.org, http://ml-india.org).

He is also interested in governance, and science education and policy. To understand the nuances of how state governments deliver benefits to the last-mile, he worked with Seva Setu, which bridges the gap between governments and people, for a year in rural Bihar in India.
