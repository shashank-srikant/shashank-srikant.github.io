<p>ವಂದನೆಗಳು .I'm a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL, MIT</a>.</p>

<p>I am interested in the intersection of machine learning, program analysis, and cognitive neuroscience. I want to understand how programs are represented - both by our brains and by machines. 
</p>

<p>Before grad school, I was a senior research engineer at Aspiring Minds' <a target="_blank" href="http://research.aspiringminds.com">research lab</a>.

I also spent a year understanding how a state government delivers its <a target="_blank" href="http://sevasetu.org/">public services in rural Bihar</a>.</p>
