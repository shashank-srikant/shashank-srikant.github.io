<p>ವಂದನೆಗಳು .I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL, MIT</a>. I'm advised by <a href="https://alfagroup.csail.mit.edu/">Dr. Una-May O'Reilly</a></p>

<p>I am interested in the intersection of machine learning, program analysis, and cognitive neuroscience. I want to understand how programs are represented - both by our brains and by machines. 
<a href="https://cap.csail.mit.edu/engage/spotlights/shashank-srikant">This CSAIL research spotlight</a> provides details on my work and interests. I also provide an overview of my research interest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tuhyQR2L0I">in this conversation</a>. <small><a href="https://shashank-srikant.github.io/bio.txt">[Third person bio]</a></small>
</p>

<p>Before grad school, I was a senior research engineer at Aspiring Minds' <a href="http://research.aspiringminds.com">research lab</a>.

I also spent a year understanding how a state government delivers its <a href="http://sevasetu.org/">public services in rural Bihar</a>.</p>
