<p>ವಂದನೆಗಳು! I am interested in the intersection of machine learning, program analysis, and cognitive neuroscience. I want to understand how programs are represented - both by our brains and by machines. 
<a href="https://cap.csail.mit.edu/engage/spotlights/shashank-srikant">This CSAIL research spotlight</a> provides details on my work and interests. I also provide an overview of my research interest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tuhyQR2L0I">in this conversation</a>. <small><a href="https://shashank-srikant.github.io/bio.txt">[Third person bio]</a></small>

<p>I was earlier a senior research engineer at Aspiring Minds' <a href="http://research.aspiringminds.com">research lab</a>.

I also spent a year understanding how a state government delivers its <a href="http://sevasetu.org/">public services in rural Bihar</a>.</p>
