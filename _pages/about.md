ವಂದನೆಗಳು! I run <a href="https://mlexperts.ai/">MLExperts.ai</a>, a boutique consulting group specializing in AI and deep tech. We assist software product teams in integrating machine learning and AI into their products. Typically, product companies face the challenge of a long list of desired features and a single data science team to handle their ML/AI efforts. They often rely on interns to prototype solutions but lack the engineering bandwidth to move these prototypes into production. At MLExperts, we address this issue by providing an expert team of AI/ML scientists and product engineers, working as an extension of the client's team to deliver that crucial feature. Our team includes scientists and product engineers with experience from top institutions like MIT, IISc, IIT, and companies like Amazon, Google, and Meta.

I have a PhD in computer science. My research interests are in machine learning, program analysis, and cognitive neuroscience. During my PhD, I studied how programs are represented by both our brains and machines. Unlike a typical PhD which explores at most two disparate fields, I connected three, which involved relearning many topics---an intellecturally rewarding process. To learn how I was drawn to studying these topics, <a href="https://shashank-srikant.github.io/assets/pdf/srikant-shash-phd-eecs-2023-thesis-ack-intro.pdf">check my thesis acknowledgment and introduction chapters</a>, or see this <a href="https://cap.csail.mit.edu/engage/spotlights/shashank-srikant">2021 research spotlight by CSAIL, MIT</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tuhyQR2L0I">this 2021 conversation</a> about my work. <small><a href="https://shashank-srikant.github.io/bio.txt">[Third person bio]</a></small>

<p>Before my PhD, I was a senior research engineer at Aspiring Minds' <a href="http://research.aspiringminds.com">research lab</a>.

I also spent a year understanding how a state government delivers its <a href="http://sevasetu.org/">public services in rural Bihar</a>.</p>
