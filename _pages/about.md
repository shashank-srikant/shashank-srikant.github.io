<p>ವಂದನೆಗಳು! I consult with startups and organizations to design and deploy products that utilize machine learning/AI, generative ML, program analysis techniques, and data analysis. I have a PhD in AI/ML, and my extensive research background has equipped me with the skills to simplify complex jargon, and convert vague problem descriptions into precise requirements and specifications. With over a decade of experience, I specialize in seamlessly integrating AI/ML into enterprise-grade software products. I have worked with Global 500 organizations such as Amazon, Microsoft, JD, and Tencent, where I integrated AI products into their workflows. <small><a href="https://shashank-srikant.github.io/bio.txt">[Third person bio]</a></small>

During my PhD, I explored problems at the intersection of three areas that at first glace will seem very different and disconnected---machine learning, program analysis, and cognitive neuroscience. I wanted to understand how programs are represented - both by our brains and by machines. I was one of the very few studying problems at this intersection---it requires an expertise in all three areas. Read my <a href="https://shashank-srikant.github.io/assets/pdf/srikant-shash-phd-eecs-2023-thesis-ack-intro.pdf">thesis acknowledgement and introduction chapters</a> to know more about what got me started in this space.

<p>Before my PhD, I was a senior research engineer at Aspiring Minds' <a href="http://research.aspiringminds.com">research lab</a>.

I also spent a year understanding how a state government delivers its <a href="http://sevasetu.org/">public services in rural Bihar</a>.</p>
