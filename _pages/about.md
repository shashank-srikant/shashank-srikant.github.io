<p>ವಂದನೆಗಳು! I consult with software product companies that work on machine learning/AI, generative ML, program analysis techniques, and data analysis. I have a PhD in computer science (focus areas: AI/ML and program analysis), and my extensive background in research has equipped me with the skills to simplify complex jargon, and convert vague problem descriptions into precise requirements and specifications. With over a decade of experience, I specialize in seamlessly integrating AI/ML into enterprise-grade software products. I have worked with Global 500 companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, JD, and Tencent, where I integrated AI products into their workflows. <small><a href="https://shashank-srikant.github.io/bio.txt">[Third person bio]</a></small>

During my PhD, I explored how machine learning, program analysis, and cognitive neuroscience intersect. I studied how programs are represented by both our brains and machines. Unlike a typical PhD which explores at most two disparate fields, I connected three, which involved relearning many topics---an intellecturally rewarding process. To learn how I was drawn to studying these topics, <a href="https://shashank-srikant.github.io/assets/pdf/srikant-shash-phd-eecs-2023-thesis-ack-intro.pdf">check my thesis acknowledgment and introduction chapters</a>, or see this <a href="https://cap.csail.mit.edu/engage/spotlights/shashank-srikant">2021 research spotlight by CSAIL, MIT</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tuhyQR2L0I">this 2021 conversation</a> about my work.

<p>Before my PhD, I was a senior research engineer at Aspiring Minds' <a href="http://research.aspiringminds.com">research lab</a>.

I also spent a year understanding how a state government delivers its <a href="http://sevasetu.org/">public services in rural Bihar</a>.</p>
