<p>ವಂದನೆಗಳು! I consult with startups and organizations to design and deploy products that utilize machine learning/AI, generative ML, program analysis techniques, and data analysis. I have a PhD in AI/ML which has trained me rigorously to cut through a lot of jargon and hazy descriptions and distill them into concrete requirements and specifications. I have over a decade's experience in integrating AI/ML into enterprise-grade software products. I have worked with Fortune 500 orgs like Amazon, Microsoft, JD, Tencent, where I've integrated AI products into their workflows.

During my PhD, I explored problems at the intersection of machine learning, program analysis, and cognitive neuroscience. I wanted to understand how programs are represented - both by our brains and by machines.

<p>Before my PhD, I was a senior research engineer at Aspiring Minds' <a href="http://research.aspiringminds.com">research lab</a>.

I also spent a year understanding how a state government delivers its <a href="http://sevasetu.org/">public services in rural Bihar</a>.</p>
