	  <h4>Anticipating Human Activities</h4>
		   <p style="text-align:justify;">
		  An important aspect of human perception is anticipation, which we use
		  extensively in our day-to-day activities when interacting with other
		  humans as well as with our surroundings. Anticipating which
		  activities will a human do next (and how to do them) can enable an
		  assistive robot to plan ahead for reactive responses in the human environments.
		  We propose a graphical model that captures the rich context of activities and object affordances,
		  and obtain the distribution over a large space of future human activities.</p>
