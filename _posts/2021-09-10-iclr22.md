## Abstract 
What aspects of computer programs are represented in the human brain during comprehension?
We leverage recordings---brain representations---from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of people comprehending Python code to evaluate the properties encoded in brain representations of computer programs.
We initially evaluate a selection of static and dynamic code properties such as abstract syntax tree (AST)-related information and runtime information.
Then to learn whether brain representations encode information beyond hand-picked properties, we evaluate alignments to representations learned by a suite of ML models.
We find that both the Multiple Demand system, a system of brain regions previously shown to respond to code, and the Language system, a system that responds exclusively to language stimuli, encode specific code properties, such as control flow and datatype, and uniquely align with machine learned representations of code.
We make all the corresponding code, data, and analysis publicly available
