If you're generally curious about how the world works, and have an interest in understanding details of how things around you work, you should definitely give research a shot. 
If you're an undergraduate at a school with a vibrant research community, it is that much easier to give it a go, and to see if you enjoy it. 

From experience, if you're interested in your coursework, and have a curious mind, and if you end up *disliking* research - then it is most likely the case of poor mentorship. Your mentor did not show you the ropes well, and did not give you the time you deserved.

Please do not be discouraged by it. Give it a shot anyway! It can be a lot of fun.

(Note - there's a reverse ask here as well. If they do give you that time, what can you do to ensure they feel their time is well spent on you. Read Jason Eisner's article below to learn more about this.)

Here's a list of topics I cover on this page.

### <a name="undergrad"></a>If you're an undergrad at a school with a great research program

If you're an undergrad at a school like MIT, which is primarily known for its research, you should _definitely_ give research a shot to get your money's worth. Making the most of your MIT experience != taking more grad classes -- these classes are pointless after a while. The best bang for your buck is in doing a UROP (undergraduate research program).

Every PI (principal investigator) here is super accomplished at what they do, and is at the bleeding edge of defining their field. 
They maybe bad teachers in the classroom, and even bad research mentors - but they definitely know their field well. You stand to learn and gain a lot.

So, do give it a shot, and see if it works well for you. 
It is very likely you'll work with someone in their group (as against directly working with them, and that's fine), and that someone can spur your interest in research. 

Here's an informative article on how to accommodate research in your otherwise busy undergraduate schedule -- [making the most of an undergrad at CMU](https://willcrichton.net/notes/making-the-most-out-of-cmu/){:target="_blank"}




### <a name="researchisnot"></a>What research is not

- _Is a huge commitment_ -- It's not a 5 year grind which will ruin your sense of a timeline of what you want to do in life. We're expected to live for >60 years. Five years of it on this enterprise is not really that big a deal. But sure - if you have filial, financial circumstances which you can't avoid, then this may be a sub-optimal life decision.
- _Is expensive_ -- It's not really. Most graduate programs will in fact pay you a monthly salary, and waive your tuition off. So you essentially are an employee being paid to produce knowledge.
- _High paying jobs_ -- It's very unlikely going to be a stepping stone to a job that pays you more. Sure - most jobs do pay higher for Ph.D. grads, but if you're in it solely for this, then something's not right.
- _God's chosen one_ -- It's unlikely you will come out of it being this invincible master of this one subject which you specalize in.  And here's something better -- the shelf-life for tangible skills you've acquired (like, say, Pytorch, or some other specific set of tools) will be 5-7 years. Be prepared to constantly skill up once you get out of your Ph.D. studies if you want your skills to remain relevant. What this experience will teach you is perhaps to think, ask questions, break problems down, communicate ideas, etc. - skills that're transferrable to any domain you go on to working on. Technical skills will remain relevant as long as you put in the effort to stay relevant.
- _Is irrelevant to reality_ -- while there may be a grain of truth to this, and there are many successful entrepreneurs who feel this way [[tweet1]](https://twitter.com/svembu/status/1218224661583937536){:target="_blank"}, [[tweet2]](https://twitter.com/svembu/status/1229193888239210496){:target="_blank"}, I still think the time investment will not terribly offset whatever purpose you have defined for yourself on this planet. In the worst case, you will use this as an opportunity to learn more about yourself. In the best, you push forward the state of science for all of us.

### <a name="doingresearch"></a>Doing research

[This article, penned by Prof. Jason Eisner at JHU](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/how-to-work-with-a-professor.html){:target="_blank"}, is an excellent primer on how you can equip yourself in having a fruitful research experience. I strongly urge you to read it, and imbibe the recommended steps in your research stint. 

[In his famous talk 'You and your research'](/assets/pdf/you_and_your_research_hamming.html), Richard Hamming describes the process of doing _good_ research.

This talk transcript I have hosted on this site is a clone of https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html

### <a name="india"></a>Aspiring researchers from India
If you are an undergrad/aspiring young researcher from India reading this - it's great you are interested in research! 

If you are from a college where there is a good culture for research, read the above section on how to make the best of it.

<a name="not-tier-1-india"></a>And importantly - if you are from a "tier-1" school, were such research opportunities do not exist for undergrads, worry not :-) I didn't have such opportunities either, and I made it through just fine. 

The catch is - it's a lot of work. 
Lot more than it usually takes to do research. 

**The summary of it is --** earnestly understand your undergrad material. During undergrad, or right after, work as an RA in a relevant lab in India to gain concrete skills and experience in research -- this could be through a summer research program (see the [Resources](#resources) section for links), or by you reaching out to labs you think are interesting. Doing this will require you to first learn concrete skills and technologies. Some details mentioned in [email 4, FAQs](#faq).

Consider then doing an M.Tech, M.S. at any of the top universities in India by writing and excelling at [GATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering), or alternatively, work at a cutting edge research lab. Finding such labs are hard, since they generally require advanced degrees to get in. Hence, your best bet is to do a masters.

In this process, figure out what problems in a particular research area really bother you which you see yourself solving, and then consider who are the best researchers in the world you who might support you to solve that problem. You should then apply to them/their university, and pursue a Ph.D. with them.

Here're my slides which hash out the above summary in some more detail. [[slides]](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w2unrVI_uW_LOloJUhFpOlyxzC8nCfpicuaEPK3da6E/edit?usp=sharing)
Also see the [FAQs](#faq) where I've responded to similar queries.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions. 
When you reach out, make sure you have read the link on the slide on how to write effective emails (it's towards the end of the google slide deck I've linked above). A post detailing best practices to follow when writing out emails is long pending. I'll get to it one day.

### <a name="background"></a>My background
I did not have a great undergrad research experience. I wanted to, but I was too ill-equipped to learn how I could have gained quality experience. I had a scholarship in my junior year to do a research internship at the CS dept. of one of the IITs in India. While I learned a couple of things there, I knew right away it wasn't a "high quality" experience. My undergrad thesis experience was great - I had a great advisor, I learned a ton of things, but it didn't train me to do quality research, and I was painfully aware of this limitation.

Thereafter, I put in a great deal of effort in finding such opportunities. By the end of my senior year, I was writing horrendous emails to academic research groups I wanted to work in. I was not skilled enough to demonstrate what my value addition would have been to a group that potentially hired me. Despite all of this, I managed to land a [great first job upon graduating](http://research.aspiringminds.com/){:target="_blank"}, where I "made my bones" in research. That's right - I was fortunate to have a job right out of undergrad which had a strong research component to it. I learned to do good research there, and went on to managing a small team of researchers on a variety of interesting and innovative projects. Had I not landed this specific job, I'd likely have applied for a full time RA with professors I'd marked out as doing "interesting work". I had offers from other good places for a generic software engineer's role - I knew I did not want to explore those options.

Looking back, I was an absolute fool at most times in my research journey. I would be stuck on silly things, I would ask trivial questions, I would just not understand certain concepts, I would not see the big-picture until a long time had passed, etc. But I kept at it because I thoroughly enjoyed learning these bits. And importantly, I had a great mentor who was patient enough to show me the ropes and indulge my inadequacies, while being encouraging.

I am where I am because of a bunch of such people who showed me the way. And I would love to support others like you who want a taste of this experience.

Over these years, I've worked on and developed an expertise in problems in machine learning, data science, program analysis, natural language processing, and systems building.

### <a name="workingwithme"></a>Working with me

Okay. We'll be working together on a project. Great. These are some things I'll be looking out for -
1. **Communication** -- I think every successful collaboration really boils down to communicating well. And this is something where our instincts can _massively_ fail us. I've been a douche in the past in matters regarding communication. And i've learnt to be better.
When in doubt, communicate. If you're stuck on something you think is trivial, communicate. If you're not enjoying what you're doing, communicate. If you missed a mileston we agreed upon, communicate. If you want more time to run some analysis, communciate. If you think i'm being unreasonable about something ... you get the drift.
Effective communication can make or break a collaboration.
And it is oddly against our instincts to have tough conversations, where either we're coming off as being inadequate, or we're pointing some shortcoming in someone else.
But what works almost always is going ahead and actually communicating it. See an example below where I dwell on this point a little more.

2. **Sincerity with your work** -- I find this important as well. Once you've decided to learn more and invest effort on some work, please start owning it. Do not expect to be followed up and parented on the progress you make. If you think you're stuck, or are unable to appreciate and understand nuances, or are not motivated any more - read point 1. above. Communicate this as early as possible.
This also relates to the article I shared [above from Prof. Jason Eisner at JHU](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/how-to-work-with-a-professor.html).
Having said that, we could be perfectly well motivated but then shirk off work. That's fine as well! We all tend to be lazy at times. Heck, I constantly struggle with it myself.
The trick again is to convey - convey that you won't be able to make progress on a given week (for whatever reason; I usually don't care), and make sure you make up for it in subsequent weeks.
If things are being constantly delayed, I'll likely notice it and discuss with you what I've noticed. 
3. **Be nice** -- no one likes to work with jerks. If you believe that you really know and understand the world a lot better than most of us, and are proud of it and would like to show this off at every instance - good luck! Unlikely we'll work together.

You'll notice, I didn't list out skills like math, doing research (?), etc. Those skills can be learnt. It's unlikely you will have these relevant skills if you are just starting off. That's what a research project will teach you.
However, if it's a "strong personality"/ego/whatever that comes in your way of communicating and owning up when you're stuck, clarifying a misunderstanding, or wanting to know more, then that's unfortunate. That will make it all the more harder for you to learn new things while having fun.
My goal is to see you morph into an independent researcher who can frame and tackle interesting problems (if you aren't there already!). We will work to get you to ask the right questions, be critical of the work you read, and learn how systematic research is done. Oftentimes, all it requires is thinking carefully about breaking seemingly large problems into manageable chunks.

Additionally, and importantly, the purpose of writing out these points is not to talk you down and set out "ground rules" - the idea here is to share how I view this world, and what works for me. If you are intimidated by all these points, please refer to point 1 :-) I assure you my intention is well meaning than any thing else.

#### A little story on the importance of communication
To drive home my point on the importance of communication, here's a little story. I had a project partner on a research project we had agreed to work on. They had most likely over-committed themselves to this work, and likely did not have the time and bandwidth to carry through with it.

What would you do in such a situation?

My younger self would have ghosted me.
That is, I would have gone into a shell and would not have wanted to have this uncomfortable conversation about my lapse in estimating my work load.

This is exactly what happened - they soon stopped responding to emails a couple of weeks into our project. 

A consequence of this is they probably messed up a working relationship which could've matured and led to subsequent fruitful collaborations.
But what's worse is they derailed an existing plan of action that was set out for the project. By not communicating clearly, they had put the onus of figuring out whether they were involved or not on me. 
And that's unfair to everyone involved.

Once the project had ended, I had a conversation with them explaining the situation. I reproduce here the email I wrote them before having a face to face meeting where we discussed these points. The purpose of reproducing it here is to share with you how I think about this situation.

Subject: Feedback on our project

hey
 
i wanted to share some  feedback  from our work over the course of our project.

while i share this  feedback  with you, i drop the hat of being a fellow student, and put on that of a manager having managed teams for a while in the industry and a slightly older colleague. i convey to you a sliver of my learning from being in similar situations before.

i think you handled communication poorly. there was an expectation of what each would pick up and work on. you seemed to have over-committed yourself to multiple other projects, which naturally made spending time on this hard. that's perfectly understandable. however, the rookie mistake to do in such cases is to go into a shell, and not convey these critical bits of information to others involved. this, in my opinion, is where things generally begin to go horribly wrong.

in our case, we just knew you had this engagement XX. what we didn't know was how much time you'd be able to spend on this project. this ought to have been clearly conveyed. even if this meant simply saying, in perhaps the first week of joining the group - "folks, i just don't have time to do any heavy-lifting. given my situation, let's work on defining something which i can perhaps put 10 hours into in total and achieve". doing something like this would have dramatically changed the equation of how things worked out. instead, the approach that unfolded was you awkwardly just ignored confronting this aspect, expecting us to understand your situation and be accommodating.

here's my take on the essentials of working in a group -
- as a policy, in the large set of use-cases i have seen, it is the _optimal move_ to explicitly convey, as soon as it is possible, any glitches you're experiencing. be it the amount of time spent on a project, being stuck on some aspect, not understanding a concept, etc.

as disarmingly simple this above maxim seems, it is practiced by very few i know. this is unfortunately never taught to us formally, and we learn it through a rather bitter set of experiences.

- do not expect to be told what your share of work is. ask for it; get it clarified.
there were points when it felt that i had to explicitly follow up multiple times to ensure you knew what you were doing. definitely avoidable. if something is not clear, call out.

but there's a brighter side to this - everyone does this. i did it at some point. and it's something we consciously can learn to undo.

i also understand that it might have been unsettling for you to have been involved in a project disconnected from your primary research interest, made worse by the rest throwing around jargon.
having said that, i think the above points i share are disconnected to it. being in a situation where you're the one with little background is totally expected in teams, and will likely happen to you again. what's critical is being sincere in letting everyone know your constraints. (case in point - you'll be surprised by the kind of dumb things i asked XX about javascript. it perhaps made me look like a genuine fool. i'll live with that as long as work got done as expected.)

again, while i share this brief feedback  with you, my point is not to undermine your effort or intention, or rub off a grudge for not being involved, or any such child-like emotion. in the larger scheme of things, the effort on this project doesn't really matter.

what matters to me personally is you go on to be a great scientist and an engineer. and from what little i have seen, these things go a long way in making one, besides being just plain smart.  

further, what i also have realized is that these little things are not often formally conveyed to folks, because of which they are oblivious of such shortcomings. it would do both, you and me, a disservice if i did not share this critical feedback  with you and simply instead shied away from having this awkward interaction. it is very likely that you will be in a similar situation in the near future in some other team, where the nature of work may be much more critical than what it was in our case.

i'm not sure how XX feels about this. i encourage you to chat with them and understand their opinion. 

i thought i should share with you my observations. i'd have ideally loved to do this face to face with you, but i have a hectic day today and tomorrow, and there's only so much effect a delayed  feedback  has.  

please let me know your thoughts. if you're not a fan of typing out replies, i would love to meet and chat over a cup of coffee.

my best to you.

### End of term/year review
If we have worked together, it is likely I'll share this little questionnaire with you. This is for you to reflect on how you did, and what more you want of this experience. The point here is to be as painfully detailed as possible. Try to list out every little thing you can remember. This will help take stock of the big picture, and help us appreciate what you learnt, and what more we can do to improve your research experience.

Also, since you'll be filling this up at the end of a term, make sure you log your work consistently to help you recollect these details. Let this not be a last-day exercise for you to fill up right before we meet to discuss this.

```
1. Rate your overall experience working on this RA stint. (good, okay, bad).
2. List in points key tasks you were engaged in this term
3. Mention concrete skills you learned during this term. 
These could be "hard" skills like Pytorch, or "soft" skills like replying in-line to emails.
4. Reflection on your achievements in the work allotted to you, and what you liked about your experience. 
e.g. you solved a weird issue you were stuck in for a while.
6. Reflection on where you thought you missed the mark, and what you did not like about your experience. 
This may not be something as strong as "did not like", but anything which you think can be improved -- in yourself, and in the overall experience.
7. Feedback for your mentor. Be critical. Try to list both positives and negatives.
8. What do you want to achieve in the upcoming term. Concrete goals for what more you want out of this experience.
```
