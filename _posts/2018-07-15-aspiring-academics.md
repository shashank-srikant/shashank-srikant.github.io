If you're generally curious about how the world works, and have an interest in understanding details of how things around you work, you should definitely give research a shot. 
If you're an undergraduate at a school with a vibrant research community, it is that much easier to give it a go, and to see if you enjoy it. 

From experience, if you're interested in your coursework, and have a curious mind, and if you end up *disliking* research - then it is most likely the case of poor mentorship. 
Your mentor did not show you the ropes well, and did not give you the time you deserved.
Please do not be discouraged by it. Give it a shot anyway! It can be a lot of fun.

(Note - there's a reverse ask here as well. If they do give you that time, what can you do to ensure they feel their time is well spent on you. Read [Jason Eisner's article below](#doingresearch) to learn more about this.)

In general, this webpage is directed at those who entered their undergrad degrees with a bleeding idealism to do great science and engineering.
Unfortunately, many with that ideaslism lose steam by the time they graduate, and instead pick a "stable" job where they may not necessarily get to do the science they once dreamt of doing.
There's nothing wrong really in exploring other verticals after your undergrad -- in fact, it's a _very_ positive sign that you want to explore something that you really enjoy.
But from my experience, I see a vast majority whose hearts are still in science, but who may just not figure out the concrete steps needed to experience high quality science and research.
This webpage will likely be of use to them.

I cover the following topics.
- [What research is not](#researchisnot)
- [Doing research](#doingresearch) - what your research advisor expects from you
- [If you're an undergrad at a school with a strong research program](#undergrad)
- [Aspiring researchers from India](#india) - Also has [some pointers](#not-tier-1-india) for those not from the top schools in India but who want to do research
- [Resources](#resources) - Advice on preparing grad school applications; links to useful summer research programs; I've also attached my academic statement from the time I applied to grad schools
- [FAQs](#faq) - My responses to email queries sent out by young researchers
- [My background](#background)
- [Acknowledgement](#ack)


### <a name="researchisnot"></a>What research is not

- _Is a huge commitment_ -- Training yourself in research by doing some advanced degree will likely take you 3-10 years (research intern, masters, Ph.D., post-docs, etc.). 
We're expected to live for > 60 years. 
3-10 years of it on this enterprise is not really that significant relatively in my opinion. 
People do work in jobs for five years, where they get to work on a range of projects, learning a couple different things along the way.
Training yourself in research is no different.
But sure - if you have filial, financial circumstances which you cannot avoid, then this may be a sub-optimal life decision.
- _Is expensive_ -- It's not really. Most graduate programs will in fact pay you a monthly salary, and waive your tuition off. So you essentially are an employee being paid to produce knowledge.
- _High paying jobs_ -- Sure - most jobs do pay higher for people with advanced degrees, but if you're in it solely for this, then something's not right.
- _God's chosen one_ -- It's unlikely you will come out of it being this invincible master of this one subject which you specalize in.  And here's something better -- the shelf-life for tangible skills you've acquired (like, say, Pytorch, or some other specific set of tools) will be 5-7 years. Be prepared to constantly skill up once you get out of your Ph.D. studies if you want your skills to remain relevant. What this experience will teach you is perhaps to think, ask questions, break problems down, communicate ideas, etc. - skills that're transferrable to any domain you go on to working on. Technical skills will remain relevant as long as you put in the effort to stay relevant.
- _Is irrelevant to reality_ -- There may be a grain of truth to this, and many successful entrepreneurs also feel this way [[tweet1]](https://twitter.com/svembu/status/1229193888239210496), I still think the time investment will not terribly offset whatever purpose you have defined for yourself on this planet.
In the worst case, you will use this as an opportunity to learn more about yourself. 
In the best, you push forward the state of science for all of us.
- _Need not require a Ph.D._ -- Not all research roles/jobs need you to have advanced degrees. 
However, not many such roles exist. 
You're likely to experience research at its best in an academic setting.
- _Need not end in you becoming a professor at some university_ -- While academia is the natural destination for anyone interested in research as a career, a number of industrial jobs which rely on innovation have very strong in-house research programs (e.g. semiconductors, materials, pharma, airlines, auto manufacturing, computer-science based industries).


### <a name="doingresearch"></a>Doing research

[This article, penned by Prof. Jason Eisner at JHU](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/how-to-work-with-a-professor.html){:target="_blank"}, is an excellent primer on how you can equip yourself in having a fruitful research experience. 
I strongly urge you to read it, and imbibe the recommended steps in your research stint. 

[In his famous talk 'You and your research'](/assets/pdf/you_and_your_research_hamming.html), Richard Hamming describes the process of doing _good_ research.

This talk transcript I have hosted on this site is a clone of https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html


### <a name="undergrad"></a>If you're an undergrad at a school with a great research program

If you're an undergrad at a school like MIT (or some other xIT in your country), which is primarily known for its research, you should _definitely_ give research a shot to get your money's worth. 
Making the most of your xIT experience != taking more grad classes -- these classes are pointless after a while. 
The best bang for your buck is in doing a UROP (undergraduate research program).

Every PI (principal investigator) in such colleges is super accomplished at what they do, and is at the bleeding edge of defining their field. 
They maybe bad teachers in the classroom, and even bad research mentors - but they definitely know their field well. 
You stand to learn and gain a lot.

So, do give it a shot, and see if it works well for you. 
It is very likely you'll work with someone in their group (as against directly working with them, and that's fine), and that someone can spur your interest in research. 

Here's an informative article on how to accommodate research in your otherwise busy undergraduate schedule -- [making the most of an undergrad at CMU](https://willcrichton.net/notes/making-the-most-out-of-cmu/){:target="_blank"}

The Jason Eisner article in the section above provides great information on what to keep in mind while you start off your research project.


### <a name="india"></a>Aspiring researchers from India-like countries\*
If you are an undergrad/aspiring young researcher from India reading this - it's great you are interested in research! 

If you are from a college where there is a good culture for research, read the above section on how to make the best of it.

#### <a name="not-tier-1-india"></a> If your undergrad college does not have a strong research environment

And importantly - if you are not from a "tier-1" school, where research opportunities do not exist for undergrads, worry not :-) I didn't have such opportunities either, and I made it through just fine. 

The catch is - it's a lot of work. 
Lot more than it usually takes to do research. 

*\** I believe the information that follows applies to most countries with an education similar to India - very few top univerisities where world-class research happens, and a long tail of engineering colleges which focus on teaching and not research.

**The summary of it is --** earnestly understand your undergrad course material. During undergrad, or right after, work as an RA in a relevant lab in India to gain concrete skills and experience in research -- this could be through a summer research program (see the [Resources](#resources) section for links), or by you reaching out to labs you think are interesting. 
Doing this will require you to first learn concrete skills and technologies. 
See the talk/slides below, and [email 1, email 4, FAQs](#faq) for details.

If you ended up having an excellent RA experience at an academic lab, or at pre-doctoral programs offered by the likes of [Google](https://research.google/careers/ai-residency/), [Micrsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/), etc., and you now have a strong sense for what you want to work on and who you think will best be able to guide you, then you should just go ahead and apply for a PhD with them.

But if you are still not sure, liked your RA experience, and want to explore this further, then consider one of --
1. doing an M.Tech/M.S. at any of (and only) the top universities in India by writing and excelling at [GATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering). A few IITs provide the option of doing an MS-by-research without needing a GATE score. This education will be essentially free of cost, while offering world class graduate level coursework+research opportunities.
2. doing an MS program outside India which has a strong thesis component + will fund you fully. Most universities in Canada provide an MASc, which is different from a professional masters degree, and is fully funded (tuition + stipend), or
3. working at a cutting edge corporate research lab. Finding such labs are hard, since they generally require advanced degrees to get in in the first place (see the [Resources](#resources) section for a few that I know of which hire undergrads).

Hence, your best bet is to do a solid masters degree where you will be exposed to advanced coursework, and state of the art research.

In this process, figure out what problems in a particular research area really bother you which you see yourself solving, and then consider who are the best researchers in the world who might support you to solve that problem. 
You should then consider applying to them/their university and doing your Ph.D. with them.
Don't worry too much about the "name" and "prestige value" of the school you apply to - people matter more. 
You are _infinitely_ better off doing your Ph.D. with a professor who you know is good but is at an "okay" university, than doing it with a professor with whom you do not sync but who's at an "elite" university.

**Details.** 
This talk provides more details.

[These are the slides I use in this talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w2unrVI_uW_LOloJUhFpOlyxzC8nCfpicuaEPK3da6E/edit?usp=sharing).

Also see the [FAQs](#faq) where I've responded to common queries which aspiring researchers typically send out to faculty.
See also Prof. Shriram's talk listed in the [Resources section](#resources) which gives you a perspective on how faculty evaluate Ph.D. candidates and applications.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have specific questions. 
When you reach out, make sure you have read the link on the slide on how to write effective emails (it's towards the end of the google slide deck I've linked above). A post detailing best practices to follow when writing out emails is long pending. I'll get to it one day.

**M.S. (outside India) vs. Ph.D.** At this point, you may be quite confused about why I'm dwelling on the specifics of Ph.D. programs.
After all, you may have a bunch of friends who head out to the US to do their masters/M.S. degrees who didn't seem to follow most of the resources provided on this page. 
How are these degrees different? 

Short answer -- it is totally different, as these programs neither expect nor will train you with the skills a Ph.D. demands/trains you for. 
These M.S. programs are meant to be professional degrees which promise to teach you skills which you can directly use in the industry. 
Most people join these M.S. programs not to improve their skills in doing research, but to land a job in the country they do their M.S. in (mostly the United States)---it's the most established route to land such jobs in another country. 

Perhaps the biggest tangible difference is the finances involved -- in a Ph.D. program, you are being paid a modest salary while you produce knowledge, and on the other hand, you pay upwards of 2-3 million Indian rupees for your masters degree (which they expect you will earn in 2-3 years on joining their workforce upon graduation). 
Note - these MS degrees are different from degrees which also support an honors thesis (typically offered by universities in Canada, and a few in the US, Europe). 
See point 2 in the summary above.

### <a name="resources"></a>Resources
I intend to keep the lists below updated. Feel free to write me an email in case you come across any more such relevant resources.

#### Advice on applying to competitive Ph.D. programs
- [Prof. Shriram Krishnamurthy](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/) talks about the Ph.D. application process in computer science in competitive Ph.D. programs in the US. [[Youtube video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IprN9fPV2LI) [[Corresponding blog post]](https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/us-cs-phd-faq/) 

**I strongly recommend you go through this talk by Shriram if you aspire to apply to Ph.D. programs in the US.** 
While he talks about computer science specifically, a lot of what he talks about should hold for other disciplines, and will help you understand what faculty look for when reviewing applications.

- Led by [Prof. Himabindu Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/), various faculty got together and spoke about the admissions process for machine learning related Ph.D. programs.
Again, while this maybe machine learning/computer science specific, it gives a sense of the general set of signals faculty look for.
 [[Youtube video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6TkkdlRWcU)

- [Prof. Fadel Adib](http://www.mit.edu/~fadel/) has a tweet thread on applying to Ph.D. programs. [[Twitter thread]](https://twitter.com/fadeladib/status/1353020072885940224)

- [Prof. Zach Lipton](https://acmilab.org/people/) tweeted about other qualities their group looks for when hiring Ph.D. candidates. [[Twitter thread]](https://twitter.com/acmi_lab/status/1459993908151214080)

- [Chaitanya Joshi](https://www.chaitjo.com/) curated a list of similar resources in [this tweet of his.](https://twitter.com/chaitjo/status/1444580607980281858)

Note - There's a sizeable overlap in the contents of each of the resources shared above. Do go through each of them nevertheless.

#### Academic statements to graduate schools
- In case this is helpful, [this is my statement of purpose / SOP / academic statement](/assets/pdf/academic_statement_of_purpose_sop_cmu.pdf) which I had submitted when applying to CMU (and from where I had an offer).

- [This is Jeremy Lacomis' application material](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jlacomis/application-info/), who was accepted to the Ph.D. program at CMU.
It contains links to other materials which inspired him.

Note - Adding keywords like `PhD CS computer science SOP statement of purpose sample example MIT CMU Stanford Berkeley` so that it gets picked up by search engines.


#### Research internships for undergraduates
- [Ubadah Sabbagh](https://www.ubadahsabbagh.com/about.html) tweeted a [thread with links to useful summer research programs](https://twitter.com/neubadah/status/1353812419911540738) for undergrads (mostly in the US).

- [Himanshu Ahuja](http://himahuja.com/) maintains an [excellent repository with links](https://github.com/himahuja/Research-Internships-for-Undergraduates) to undergraduate research programs in India and around the globe.

- I mention a few more in Email 1 and 4 listed in the [FAQs](#faq) section.

#### Research jobs in India offered to undergrads
I don't know a lot of product research groups where academic-style research happens, with publications at good venues as one of its goals. 
The orgs I list below may no longer maintain active research groups/fit the above criteria. 
You should definitely reach out to the founders directly (these are typically small orgs) and check with them.
Also note - these are mostly jobs in computer science, since that's the field I'm most familiar with.
If you come across any more, please do write to me.

#### <a name="paper"></a>Publishing your first paper
[This excellent blog](https://achuwilson.github.io/post/2017-06-15-icra17/) by [Achu Wilson](https://achuwilson.github.io/) documents what it took him to publish his first research paper in one of the best conferences out there for robotics. 
Achu did not have typical RA-like opportunities during his undergrad.

#### <a name="faq"></a>FAQs
My responses to some queries I have received over email and other social media over the years. 
My responses echo most of the content mentioned on this webpage.

- [[email 1]](/assets/pdf/email1.txt): Thoughtful questions on the Ph.D. applications process. Many of my suggestions I had responded with in this email have also been iterated by Shriram in his talk since (see [Resources](#resources)).

### <a name="background"></a>My background
I did not have a great undergrad research experience. I wanted to, but I was too ill-equipped to learn how I could have gained quality experience. I had a scholarship in my junior year to do a research internship at the CS dept. of one of the IITs in India. While I learned a couple of things there, I knew right away it wasn't a "high quality" experience. My undergrad thesis experience was great - I had a great advisor, I learned a ton of things, but it didn't train me to do quality research, and I was painfully aware of this limitation.

Thereafter, I put in a great deal of effort in finding such opportunities. By the end of my senior year, I was writing horrendous emails to academic research groups I wanted to work in. I was not skilled enough to demonstrate what my value addition would have been to a group that potentially hired me. Despite all of this, I managed to land a [great first job upon graduating](http://research.aspiringminds.com/){:target="_blank"}, where I "made my bones" in research. That's right - I was fortunate to have a job right out of undergrad which had a strong research component to it. I learned to do good research there, and went on to managing a small team of researchers on a variety of interesting and innovative projects. Had I not landed this specific job, I'd likely have applied for a full time RA with professors I'd marked out as doing "interesting work". I had offers from other good places for a generic software engineer's role - I knew I did not want to explore those options.

Looking back, I was an absolute fool at most times in my research journey. I would be stuck on silly things, I would ask trivial questions, I would just not understand certain concepts, I would not see the big-picture until a long time had passed, etc. But I kept at it because I thoroughly enjoyed learning these bits. And importantly, I had a great mentor who was patient enough to show me the ropes and indulge my inadequacies, while being encouraging.

I am where I am because of a bunch of such people who showed me the way. And I would love to support others like you who want a taste of this experience.

Over these years, I've worked on and developed an expertise in problems in machine learning, data science, program analysis, natural language processing, and systems building.
