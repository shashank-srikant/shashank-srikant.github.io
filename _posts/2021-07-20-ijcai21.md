## Abstract 
The use of neuro-symbolic methods to supplement the performance of deep learning based natural language inference models has witnessed a resurgence. 
In this work, we review three sets of recent results in human cognition experiments -- in natural language comprehension, in natural language inference, and in computer program comprehension - a field bearing similarities to natural language. 
In light of these three works, we discuss the broader role cognitive neuroscience can play in informing the design of neuro-symbolic inference model architectures for language.
